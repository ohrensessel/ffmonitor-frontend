ffmonitor-frontend
==================

This is the frontend code of ohrensessel/ffmonitor

The code is quite dirty, sorry about that.
This was only intended as a quick solution to display the data produced by the backend.
So be aware that this is really dirty code and not following a nice coding style.
Any contributions would be highly appreciated.

Requirements:
- namedb.json and stats.txt directly in the frontend folder
- subfolder graphs containing the backend generated graphs
