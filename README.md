ffmonitor-frontend
==================

This is the frontend code of ohrensessel/ffmonitor

The code is quite dirty, sorry about that.
This was only intended as a quick solution to display the data produced by the backend.

Requirements:
- namedb.json and stats.txt directly in the frontend folder
- subfolder graphs containing the backend generated graphs
